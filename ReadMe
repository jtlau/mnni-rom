Lmnet_ROM.py is the main driver

Important parameters: 
"d" input dimension, 
"neural" the total unit at each layer
"layers" number of layers
change "M" (1,2,3,4..) to choose different step
change scheme="AM" to choose different discretization.  
'AM': Adams_Moulton,
'AB': Adams_Bashforth,
'BDF': backward_difference_formula

The training data "Xtrain \in r X Ns", each coloum corresponds to the ROM coefficients 
at each time step, r is the system dimension, Ns is the number of snapshots.

Multistep_NN.py contains the function class needed

Data folder contains training data for 2D NSE and 1D burgers equation


PECENN_ROM.py is the driver code for predictor-corrector discretization method. hyper-parameters are the same as in Lmnet_rom.py
multistep_PECE.py is the function class for PECE neural network model.
